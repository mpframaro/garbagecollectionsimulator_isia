# Garbage Collection Simulator Using Reinforcment Learning

This project was done for a third year curricular unit (Introdução a Sistemas Inteligentes e Autónomos).

Using Python, I created a program that generates a town with a random layout on a grid and, using reinforcment learning, trained agents that are capable of deciding the best routes for garbage collection.
These agents were implemented using SPADE and act in a descentralized manner, using the ControlNET Protocol, which I implemented.

The PDF allows for a better understanding of this project, listing every feature, experiment, result, ...
